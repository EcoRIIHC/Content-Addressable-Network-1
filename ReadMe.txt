Distributed Systems - Project1

The implementation covers:
1. File insert (with a simple String keyword)
2. File retrieve (with a simple String keyword)
3. View peer information (node ID, IP Address, coordinates, data items)
4. Peer join (with random x and y coordinates)
5. Peer leave is NOT attempted and the leave option simply  exits out of the code.

Server
The bootstrap server should contain the interface as well as the implementation of the interface i.e. BootStrapServer.java and 
BootStrapServerImpl.java
Client:
The client should contain the Peer.java, PeerImpl.java and the Neighbor.java files

To start the project, first run BootStrapServer.java file on the server machine and then run Peer.java on the client machines
